- The declaration of a static defined constant must include the modifier `final`, indicates that its value cannot be changed.
- Static constants belong to the class as a whole, not to each object. There is only one copy of a static constant.

- Without instantiating the inner class, we still can visit its inner static members.
- If we want to trigger the constructor of the inner class, just create an instance.
